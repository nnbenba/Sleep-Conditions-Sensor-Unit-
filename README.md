# Somna: Sleep-Conditions-Sensor-Unit-
Somna is a smart sleep optimization system designed to improve sleep quality by monitoring and learning from bedroom environmental conditions. The device uses a combination of sensors to measure sound levels (KY-037), ambient light (BH1750), and temperature and humidity (DHT22) throughout the night. These environmental readings are paired with sleep performance data collected via the Oura Ring API, which provides precise sleep and wake times as well as a nightly sleep score ranging from 0 to 100. For each night, environmental sensor data is averaged over the exact interval during which sleep occurred, ensuring accurate alignment between sleep conditions and outcomes. Each set of nightly conditions is then labeled with the corresponding sleep score to form a supervised learning dataset.

To model the relationship between environmental factors and sleep quality, I implemented eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), a powerful ensemble learning method well suited for structured data and nonlinear interactions. The model takes average temperature, humidity, light intensity, and sound level as inputs and learns how these variables jointly influence sleep quality for the individual user. Rather than relying on fixed heuristics or generalized sleep recommendations, Somna leverages this trained model to infer personalized environmental conditions that are most likely to optimize future sleep scores. By integrating real-time sensing, wearable health data, and machine learning, Somna demonstrates an end-to-end, data-driven approach to personalized sleep optimization.
