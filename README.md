# Sleep-Conditions-Sensor-Unit-
I'm creating a device that monitors sleeping environmental conditions to optimize sleep quality by using sound (KY037), light (BH1750), temperature &amp; humidity (DHT22) sensors. These readings will provide feedback based on their current conditions to optimize their bedroom temperature, humidity, brightness, and sound levels.
